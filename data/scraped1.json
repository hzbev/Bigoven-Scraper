If you are lucky, you may see some chunk style at a higher price per pound.\nIf there isn't a spice bag in with the brisket, you will need to get some whole peppercorns (white and black) and bay leaves.\n------------Selecting the Cabbage-------------------.\nThe heavier and more solid it is, the better it is.\nSmell it to make sure it isn't too bitter.\nYou may have to go to another store if the whole batch has a very strong bitter smell. I have had to visit several stores to find a decent batch.\nKeep in mind that the outer leaves will be discarded even if the store has already removed the natural outer leaves to make them look better and fresher.\n--------------Selecting the Potatoes----------------.\nWatch out for the red dyed ones.\nPick out a bag of medium to small sized ones.\nThe smaller the better.\nIf you are lucky enough to find the ones as small as salad tomatoes, they are the best.\n-------------Selecting the Carrots----------.\nGet the smallest bag they have unless you like carrots, because you will only use one per pot of cabbage to take any bitterness out of the cabbage.\nServing a bowl of carrots is a big no no on Saint Patrick's Day.\nPreparing and cooking the meal-----------------------.\n(It's going to take 3 hours with you there).\nUse a large Dutch oven or stock pot that will hold everything all at once.\nPlace the brisket (best side up) in the bottom of the pot.\nThere's no need to rinse it because nothing bad will survive what you are about to do to it and you will remove the outer marinate.\nAdd the spice packet or a teaspoonful of peppercorns and two bay leaves.\nCover the brisket generously with water and a bottle of beer (optional - adds flavor and is a tenderizer).\nBring to a boil.\nReduce heat, cover and simmer for 2 hours.\nDuring the 2 hours------------------------.\nScrub and rinse the new red potatoes.\nRemove any eyes and bad spots.\nLeave as much of the peel as you can.\nQuarter them (halve or whole if tiny).\nCover with water until ready for them.\nRemove the outer leaves from the cabbage until the leaves are entirely light green, rinse and cut it into quarters through the spine so they stay together. Set aside.\nPeel one carrot and cut it into quarters. Set aside.\nPeel the onion and cut it into eighths. Set aside.\nRinse the bunch of fresh parsley and chop up just the tops into very tiny pieces.\nI find that kitchen scissors do just fine.\nAfter the 2 hours----------------------.\nAdd the potatoes on top of the brisket.\nAdd water to cover everything.\nBring to a boil.\nReduce heat, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.\nAdd the cabbage on top of the potatoes and add onion and carrot on top of the cabbage.\nAdd water to cover everything.\nBring to a boil.\nReduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.\nCheck the cabbage to see if it is tender.\nIf not, simmer another 5 minutes. You shouldn't undercook it and it's hard to overcook it.\nWhen done-----------------------.\nIn a large serving bowl where you can stir the potatoes, crush the garlic clove and rub the inside of the bowl with it.\nPlace the potatoes in the bowl while still piping hot and add (at least) a quarter pound of butter and add a handful (more is better than less) of chopped fresh parsley.\nGently stir until butter is melted, it coats all the potato pieces and the parsley is evenly distributed.\nPut the rest of the parsley into a tiny serving bowl for those who want to add more to their potatoes.\nAs I said, more is better.\nSlice the brisket cross grain.\nHope there is leftovers for breakfast.\nSee my March 18th Breakfast!

10\" wide, 3\" deep) fireproof casserole and warm over moderate heat.\nSaute the lardons for 2 to 3 minutes to brown lightly.\nRemove to a side dish with a slotted spoon.\nDry off the pieces of beef and saute them, a few at a time in the hot oil/bacon fat until nicely browned on all sides.\nOnce browned, remove to the side plate with the bacon.\nIn the same oil/fat, saute the onion and the carrot until softened.\nPour off the fat and return the lardons and the beef to the casserole with the carrots and onion.\nToss the contents of the casserole with the salt and pepper and sprinkle with the flour.\nSet the uncovered casserole in the oven for four minutes.\nToss the contents of the casserole again and return to the hot oven for 4 more minutes.\nNow, lower the heat to 325\u00b0F and remove the casserole from the oven.\nAdd the wine and enough stock so that the meat is barely covered.\nAdd the tomato paste, garlic and herbs and the bacon rind.\nBring to a simmer on the top of the stove.\nCover and place in the oven, adjusting the heat so that the liquid simmers very slowly for three to four hours.\nThe meat is done when a fork pierces it easily.\nWhile the meat is cooking, prepare the onions and mushrooms and set them aside till needed.\nFor the onion, if using frozen, make sure they are defrosted and drained.\nHeat the butter and oil in a large skillet and add the onions to the skillet.\nSaute over medium heat for about ten minutes, rolling the onions about so they brown as evenly as possible, without breaking apart.\nPour in the stock, season to taste, add the herbs, and cover.\nSimmer over low heat for about 40 to 50 minutes until the onions are perfectly tender but retain their shape and the liquid has mostly evaporated.\nRemove the herbs and set the onions aside.\nFor the mushrooms, heat the butter and oil over high heat in a large skillet.\nAs soon as the foam begins to subside add the mushrooms and toss and shake the pan for about five minutes.\nAs soon as they have browned lightly, remove from heat.\nTo Finish the Stew:.\nWhen the meat is tender, remover the casserole from the oven and empty its contents into a sieve set over a saucepan.\nWash out the casserole and return the beef and bacon to it (discarding the bits of carrot and onion and herbs which remain in the sieve).\nDistribute the mushrooms and onions over the meat.\nSkim the fat off the sauce and simmer it for a minute or two, skimming off any additional fat which rises to the surface.\nYou should be left with about 2 1/2 cups of sauce thick enough to coat a spoon lightly.\nIf the sauce is too thick, add a few tablespoons of stock.\nIf the sauce is too thin, boil it down to reduce to the right consistency.\nTaste for seasoning.\nPour the sauce over the meat and vegetables.\nIf you are serving immediately, place the covered casserole over medium low heat and simmer 2 to 3 minutes.\nServe in the casserole or on a warm platter surrounded by noodles, potatoes or rice and garnished with fresh parsley.\nIf serving later or the next day, allow the casserole to cool and place cold, covered casserole in the refrigerator.\n20 minutes prior to serving,
